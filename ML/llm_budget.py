"""
Short-TTL answer cache, and the ranked model fallback list.

WHY A CACHE EXISTS. The provider allowance is the binding constraint, not
latency: this key is on OpenRouter's free tier, which allows 50 model requests
per day. A demo where several people ask the same question — or ask the same
question twice after a typo — burns allowance for no new information. A short
TTL removes exactly that waste while still going stale quickly, because a
weather answer that is 60 seconds old is fine and one that is 10 minutes old is
not.

The cache is keyed on the NORMALISED prompt, so "Will it rain in Kochi?" and
"will it rain in kochi?" and trailing-whitespace variants share an entry. It is
in-process and deliberately not persistent: a stale entry surviving a restart
would be worse than a miss.

WHY A FALLBACK LIST. Free models sit on shared upstream pools and fail
intermittently (429, 503). When the primary is busy, a different free model on
a different provider usually answers. The list is ordered by measured
tool-calling behaviour, not by the model page, and each entry records when it
was actually verified.
