    Answer a weather question.

    Two distinct paths, and the difference matters for testing:

      FAST_PATH  `fast_weather_response` recognises simple, unambiguous
                 questions and answers them from Open-Meteo directly WITHOUT
                 calling a model. This is product functionality (fast, free,
                 deterministic for the common cases) and it is kept.

      LLM_BACKED anything else is sent to the OpenRouter-hosted model with the
                 weather tools available.

    Responses declare which path served them in the `X-Response-Path` header, so
    a test (or an operator) can tell a regex answer from real model inference
    without guessing. Prompt-security results from the fast path are NOT
    evidence about the model.
