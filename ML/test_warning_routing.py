"""
FIX 1 verification: warning intent routes to a deterministic lookup.

Every case asserts TWO things:
  * the answer is correct for the case, and
  * ZERO model calls were made.

The second assertion is the important one. "The answer looks right" is
compatible with a model having produced it, and this whole fix exists because a
model can produce a plausible wrong warning. The proof is that `get_agent` is
never called, not that the text reads well.
