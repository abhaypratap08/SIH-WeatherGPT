LangChain Weather Agent
=======================

A LangChain "tool calling" agent that answers natural-language weather
questions like:

    "What's the weather like in Delhi?"
    "Will it rain in Mumbai?"
    "Is it hot in New York?"

Model provider: OpenRouter, over its OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The previous
local Ollama path has been removed entirely — it is not a fallback, and
nothing in this file references localhost:11434 any more.

Weather data itself needs no key: the free Open-Meteo APIs are used for
  1. Geocoding a place name -> latitude/longitude
  2. Fetching current weather + today's forecast for those coordinates

Configuration (environment only — never hardcoded, never sent to the browser):
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY   required; the only secret this service reads
  LLM_MODEL            optional model id, default DEFAULT_MODEL

# It was originally `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free`. That model advertises
# tools, but on this key it is unusable: every request returns HTTP 429 from the
# upstream provider ("limit_source: upstream_provider_shared_pool", Google AI
# Studio). `qwen/qwen3.8-27b:free` and `google/gemma-4-31b-it:free` behave the
# same way. Those are shared free pools, so this is a capacity problem, not a
# property of the model.
#
# `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` passed `smoke_test_llm.py` 13/13 on
# 2026-09-28: it emitted a real tool call, the tool executed, and the tool's
# actual value reached the final answer. `liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free` also emitted
# tool calls and is a smaller fallback.
#
# Override with LLM_MODEL. Free models sit on shared pools and return 429/503
# intermittently, which is why transient provider failures are retried rather
# than surfaced to the user.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are WeatherGPT, a helpful AI weather assistant aligned with IMD (India Meteorological Department) standards.

For ANY question about weather, temperature, rain, heat, cold, wind, etc.
in a place, you MUST use your tools to get real data — never guess or use
prior knowledge about typical weather.

Workflow:
1. Call `geocode_place` with the place name mentioned by the user to get
   its latitude/longitude.
2. Call `get_weather` with that latitude/longitude to get current
   conditions and today's forecast.
3. Answer the user's actual question directly and concisely in plain
   language (e.g. "Yes, it's likely to rain in Mumbai today — about a
   70% chance, with 12mm expected."). Include the temperature in
   Celsius. Don't dump raw JSON at the user.
4. If relevant, add a brief actionable advisory (e.g. carry an umbrella,
   avoid outdoor work during peak heat, etc.).

If the place cannot be found, say so clearly instead of guessing.

CAPABILITIES AND LIMITS — state these plainly, do not paper over them:

- Your tools report conditions for a SINGLE point: one latitude/longitude at
  one moment. There is no route, journey, traffic or travel-time tool.
- A question about travelling from A to B (e.g. "I need to travel from
  Gaur Yamuna City to Pari Chowk, is it safe to carry an umbrella today?")
  has two parts. You CAN assess the weather at the named places, and you CAN
  give advice grounded in that retrieved data. You CANNOT assess conditions
  along the journey, the travel time, or anything between the two points.
  Say which part you could and could not check, in one short clause, then
  still answer the part you can. Do not imply you checked the route.
- When a place cannot be resolved (a landmark, a small locality, a spelling
  variant), say which place you could not identify and ask for the city or
  district. Do not silently substitute a different place you guessed.
- Separate the three kinds of statement in your answer so the user can tell
  them apart: the WEATHER FACT you retrieved, the INFERENCE you drew from
  it, and the RECOMMENDATION you are making. "Rain chance is 70% (data).
  That is likely to mean a wet commute (inference). Carrying an umbrella
  would be sensible (recommendation)."
- Only recommend an action when the retrieved data supports it. If the data
  shows no rain, do not suggest an umbrella just because rain gear was
  mentioned in the question.
- IMD publishes official weather warnings for districts in India only. For a
  location outside India, say that IMD does not cover it rather than implying
  there is or is not a warning.
