"""
BUG 2: "not configured" returned while a valid key existed in .env.

The failure is not a bad key. It is that the process answering :8000 and the
.env on disk were talking about different worlds, and neither said so. Two
mechanisms are under test:

  A. the port guard must REFUSE to start a service on an occupied port, so a
     stale process can never keep serving code you did not just start;
  B. the service must report the inputs it loaded and shout when they disagree
     with the .env on disk.

Every case uses throwaway .env files in a temp dir. The real key is never
read, copied, logged, or printed, and a tripwire below fails the run if the
value of a key ever appears in output.
