"""
FIX 2 + FIX 3 verification, entirely against MOCKS. No live model calls.

Covers:
  * the output guard: a real leak (verbatim prompt text) is refused;
  * normal weather answers pass through untouched, so the guard is not
    simply refusing everything;
  * the 5 flagged red-team payloads, 3 runs each, with both a compliant and a
    leaking mock, to show the guard holds even when the model complies;
  * daily-cap 429: no retry ladder, honest reset-time message;
  * short-window 429: still retried with backoff;
  * 401: still not retried;
  * the system prompt contains no secrets.
