# 🌦️ WeatherGPT

### AI-Powered Conversational Weather Intelligence Platform

WeatherGPT is an AI-powered conversational weather platform designed to make **real-time meteorological information, forecasts, warnings, historical analysis, and weather-based decision support** easily accessible through natural language.

Instead of requiring users to navigate multiple weather portals, bulletins, satellite products, and forecasting systems, WeatherGPT provides a unified conversational interface where users can simply ask questions such as:

> "Will it rain in Delhi tomorrow?"

> "Is it safe to travel to Dehradun this weekend?"

> "Give me a weather advisory for farmers in Punjab."

> "What is the temperature trend in Mumbai over the last 10 years?"

The system combines **weather APIs, meteorological datasets, forecasting models, GIS information, disaster warnings, and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate contextual and actionable weather intelligence.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Weather information is often distributed across multiple platforms, including:

* Weather portals
* Government bulletins
* Satellite data
* Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models
* Disaster warning systems
* Historical climate databases
* Forecasting APIs

This makes it difficult for common users, researchers, farmers, disaster managers, and government agencies to quickly obtain the information they actually need.

WeatherGPT addresses this problem by providing a **single intelligent conversational interface** for accessing and understanding meteorological information.

# 🏗️ Core Components

## 1. Frontend

The frontend provides the conversational interface.

Possible technologies:

* React Native
* Flutter
* React.js
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Main screens:

```text
Home
 ├── Chat
 ├── Current Weather
 ├── Forecast
 ├── Alerts
 ├── Weather Map
 ├── Climate Analysis
 └── Settings
```

---

## 2. Backend

The backend manages:

* User requests

```

---

## 3. AI Query Understanding Engine

The LLM acts as the natural-language understanding layer.

For example:

```text
"What will the weather be like in Agra tomorrow evening?"
```

can be converted into:

```json
{
  "location": "Agra",
  "date": "tomorrow",
  "time_range": "evening",
  "information_required": [
    "temperature",
    "rainfall",
    "wind",
    "weather_condition"
  ]
}
```

The backend then retrieves the required data.

---

# 🤖 AI Architecture

WeatherGPT should **not allow the LLM to invent weather information**.

Instead, the system follows a data-grounded architecture:

```text
User Question
      ↓
LLM
      ↓
Intent + Location + Time Extraction
      ↓
Weather API / Database / NWP Model
      ↓
Verified Weather Data
      ↓
LLM
      ↓
Contextual Response
```

This approach reduces hallucination and improves reliability.

---

# 🗄️ Data Sources

The platform can integrate multiple meteorological sources.

Potential data sources include:

* Weather APIs
* Government meteorological datasets
* Satellite products
* GFS
* WRF
* Historical climate datasets
* Disaster warning feeds
* GIS datasets

The architecture is designed so that additional data providers can be added without changing the entire application.

# 🔄 Example Query Flow

Consider the query:

```text
"Will there be heavy rain in Mumbai tomorrow?"
```

### Step 1 — Query Understanding

The AI identifies:

```json
{
  "location": "Mumbai",
  "date": "tomorrow",
  "query_type": "rainfall",
  "severity": "heavy"
}
```

### Step 2 — Data Retrieval

Backend requests forecast data for Mumbai.

### Step 3 — Weather Analysis

The system evaluates:

* Rain probability
* Expected rainfall
* Wind speed
* Weather warnings
* Existing alerts

### Step 4 — AI Response

The LLM converts the structured information into a natural-language answer.

### Step 5 — Advisory

If necessary, the system provides an actionable recommendation.

Recommended practices:

* API authentication
* Rate limiting
* Input validation
* Secure environment variables
* Database access control
* API timeout handling
* Weather-source verification
* Logging and monitoring
* Graceful failure when external APIs are unavailable

The AI should clearly distinguish between:

```text
Observed data
Forecast data
Historical data
AI-generated advisory
```

---

# 🚀 Installation

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WeatherGPT.git

cd WeatherGPT
```

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

`start.sh` looks for the virtualenv at **`.venv`** in the project root. Use that
exact name, or the launcher falls back to the system `python3` and the services
fail on missing imports.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### Windows

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

There is no root-level `requirements.txt`. Python dependencies live per service,
and both run from the same `.venv`:

```bash
pip install -r ML/requirements.txt             # AI agent + route weather
pip install -r voice_service/requirements.txt  # optional, see 3a
```

`./start.sh setup` installs both. The second pulls PyTorch, so read 3a first if
you would rather not pay that cost.

### 3a. Voice service dependencies (opt-in)

The voice service is **optional**. It is a separate Python service that runs
from the same virtual environment as the ML service, and it needs three extra
packages:

| Package | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `python-multipart` | `/stt/transcribe` request parsing | tiny, pure Python |
| `openai-whisper` | speech-to-text | **pulls PyTorch — install the CPU build first** |
| `gTTS` / `pyttsx3` | text-to-speech | small |

**Install torch CPU-only first, then the rest.** This project transcribes CPU
audio and never uses CUDA, but the default torch pulls multi-gigabyte CUDA
wheels, and installing it with a download cache failed here with
`OSError: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded` while `df` reported 400 GB+ free:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
pip install --no-cache-dir -r voice_service/requirements.txt
```

`./start.sh setup` does exactly this, in this order. Transcription also needs a
system `ffmpeg` on `PATH`; `start.sh` does not install system packages.

**To install them by hand instead:**

```bash
pip install python-multipart
pip install -r voice_service/requirements.txt   # includes openai-whisper
```

**To skip voice entirely** — the rest of the app does not need any of it:

```bash
pip install python-multipart
```

With that, the voice service starts and reports its real state instead of
crashing:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health
# {"status":"healthy","voice_enabled":false,"stt_available":false,"tts_available":false}
```

`stt_available: false` / `tts_available: false` means exactly that — the service
is up, speech is not. The web app's text, map, forecast and chat features are
unaffected.

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file **in the project root**. The ML service loads it on
startup, so a key placed here is picked up without exporting it in your shell.
`.env` is gitignored; never commit it.

```env
# Required for the AI chat agent. The provider is OpenRouter, reached through
# its OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Without this key the chat returns
# "not configured" and every non-fast-path question fails.
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key

# Optional. Overrides the free-tier default model if you want a different one.
# LLM_MODEL=google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free
```

Weather data comes from Open-Meteo and needs no key. Verify what the service
resolved, without exposing the key:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok",...,"model_provider":"openrouter","model_provider_configured":true}
```

`model_provider_configured: false` means the key was not found, which usually
means the `.env` is in the wrong directory. A key that is present but rejected
surfaces as HTTP 502 on `/agent`, not 503.

## 5. Start the Services

The easiest route is the launcher, which starts all four services:

```bash
./start.sh
```

To run the Python ML backend on its own, note the entry point is
`ML/main.py`, so the module is `main` and it must be started from inside `ML/`:

```bash
cd ML
../.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Backend will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

## 6. Running the Tests

### Java backend

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
```

Last full run: **140 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped** across 20 classes.

| Test class | Covers |
|---|---|
| `AuthControllerTest` | registration, login, JWT issuance |
| `JwtTokenProviderTest` | token signing, expiry, validation |
| `CorsConfigurationTest` | allowed origins and methods |
| `AlertServiceTest` | alert assembly and filtering |
| `AlertControllerTest` | alert endpoints |
| `NoOpAlertProviderTest` | the no-op provider fallback |
| `ImdEarlyWarningServiceTest` | IMD early-warning parsing |
| `WeatherServiceTest` | weather aggregation |
| `WeatherControllerTest` | weather endpoints |
| `WeatherCoordinateAwareEndpointsTest` | coordinate-first endpoint contract |
| `WeatherQueryFlowTest` | end-to-end query flow |
| `WeatherResponseGeneratorTest` | response text generation |
| `ClimateAnalysisServiceTest` | climate metric generation |
| `NwpModelServiceTest` | NWP model handling |
| `SectorAdvisoryServiceTest` | sector advisories |
| `OpenMeteoGeocodingProviderTest` | geocoding provider |
| `OpenMeteoWeatherProviderTest` | weather provider |
| `DeterministicWeatherQueryInterpreterTest` | query interpretation |
| `LlmQueryUnderstandingServiceTest` | LLM query understanding |
| `LocalizationServiceTest` | language handling |

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run typecheck   # tsc -b --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint src
npm test            # node --test ../tests/*.test.ts
npm run build       # tsc -b && vite build
```

`npm test` runs the zero-dependency Node test suites in `tests/`
(`location_core.test.ts`, `radar_core.test.ts`).

### API safety guard

```bash
./scripts/verify-api-safety.sh
```

Builds the app under seven `VITE_*` configurations and asserts the effective
API base URL, so a local session cannot silently reach a deployed service.

WeatherGPT can provide:

```text
🌧️ Rain is highly likely this evening.

If you're planning to travel, consider leaving earlier
because heavy rainfall may reduce visibility and cause
waterlogging in low-lying areas.
```

The goal is to move from **"weather data" → "weather intelligence."**
